<p>Even the words “stay sober”—let alone live sober—offended many
of us when we first heard such advice. Although we had done a lot of
drinking, many of us never felt drunk, and were sure we almost never
appeared or sounded drunk. Many of us never staggered, fell, or got
thick tongues; many others were never disorderly, never missed a day
at work, never had automobile accidents, and certainly were never
hospitalized nor jailed for drunkenness.</p>
<p>We knew lots of people who drank more than we did, and people
who could not handle their drinks at all. We were not like that. So the
suggestion that maybe we should “stay sober” was almost insulting.</p>
<p>Besides, it seemed unnecessarily drastic. How could we live that
way? Surely, there was nothing wrong with a cocktail or two at a busi-
ness lunch or before dinner. Wasn’t everyone entitled to relax with a
few drinks, or have a couple of beers before going to bed?</p>
<p>However, after we learned some of the facts about the illness called
alcoholism, our opinions shifted. Our eyes have been opened to the
fact that apparently millions of people have the disease of alcoholism.
Medical science does not explain its “cause,” but medical experts on
alcoholism assure us that any drinking at all leads to trouble for the
alcoholic, or problem, drinker. Our experience overwhelmingly con-
firms this.</p>
<p>So not drinking at all—that is, staying sober—becomes the basis of
recovery from alcoholism. And let it be emphasized: Living sober turns
out to be not at all grim, boring, and uncomfortable, as we had feared,
but rather something we begin to enjoy and find much more exciting
than our drinking days. We’ll show you how.</p>`
